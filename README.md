# License-Plate-Detection-and-Recognition
This project performs automatic license plate detection and OCR-based recognition from videos using a fine-tuned YOLOv8 model and EasyOCR. It includes custom logic for text correction, format validation, and temporal stabilization to improve the accuracy and consistency of detected license plates across video frames.
